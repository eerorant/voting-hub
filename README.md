# Voting hub

A web app to host rooms, where users can send questions. Users then answer the questions by clicking the yes or no buttons. After all users have answered or 
enough time is passed the the results will be shown. After the results have been shown, the room moves on to the next question. An admin will be able to moderate the rooms. I might add a chat to the app.
