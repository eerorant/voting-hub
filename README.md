# Voting hub

A web app to host rooms, where users can send in questions. Users then answer the questions by clicking the yes or no buttons. An admin will be able to moderate the room and remove questions he deems unfit.
### Link to the website

[Voting hub](https://tsoha-votinghub.herokuapp.com/)

### Using the website
Create a room and share the url with your friends! Anyone can submit questions and vote on them. Right now you can vote as many times as you want, but that will change in the future so that one user gets one vote. You can use the username "john" and password "pass" or create your own user. Go to /rooms/<number> to go a room.
