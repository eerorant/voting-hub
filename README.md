# Voting hub

A web app to host rooms, where users can send in questions. Users then answer the questions by clicking the yes or no buttons. An admin will be able to moderate the room and remove questions he deems unfit.

### Using the website
Create a room and share the url with your friends! Anyone can submit questions and vote on them. You only get one vote per question. When you create a room, you get admin rights in that room, that allow you to remove inappropriate comments. You can use the username "john" and password "pass" or create your own user. Go to /rooms/*room_name* to go to a room.
