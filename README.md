# Voting hub

A web app to host rooms, where users can send in questions. Users then answer the questions by clicking the yes or no buttons. An admin will be able to moderate the room and remove questions he deems unfit.

### Using the website
Right now the rooms are empty and all the questions are still on their own global page. This will change, every room will have their own, unique set of questions and admins. You can use the username "john" and password "pass" or create your own user.
